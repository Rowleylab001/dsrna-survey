Decided to take a lower-effort approach to tying up loose ends and just put 
all the R scripts to generate tables and graphs together in one Rmd

Discovered the numbers were off when recreating Table 1 (the summary of dsRNA/killer prevalence).
This is likely due to the fact that these exact permutations were not requested and instead 
were summed post hoc. The data set has also been altered since the original numbers were calculated. 

???   Do I need to investigate this, or trust the new results?

#### Bubble Plots

Worked on Fig. 3ab (bubble plots). They're looking awesome now!
However, the figures in the manuscript need to be changed because there is a 357-strain point
when Y-2046 is included. This is presumably strains that only kill Y-2046, since 
643 - 357 = 286 strains. 

* All strains:

	> max(pcaDF.agg.combo$num_strains)	[1] 357

	> sum(pcaDF.agg.combo$num_strains)	[1] 643

* No Y-2046:

	> max(pcaDF.agg.combo$num_strains)	[1] 58

	> sum(pcaDF.agg.combo$num_strains)	[1] 286

#### Genome-encoded toxins

???   in Table 3 including strains that have either KHR or KHS data (should this be BOTH?)

- 1 strain off original on Table 3 -KHS1/-KHR1 killers (not too bad!)

???   Do we need to update our raw data sheet for public use? (if so, I need to redo Rmd)

- ERROR: plot.new() margin error was resolved by removing the "lhei" argument from heatmap.2 plot. 
Note that heatmap.2 plots must be manually run within R Studio in order to properly update the 
SVG files. If they're ggplots, then everything works fine. Frickin heatmap.2 givin me grief. 

>> Next time: work on supplementary figures
